### Upgrading from 1.x

Version 2.0.0 renamed this plugin from `sidecar/craft-analytics` to
`sidecar/craft-ga` and changed its handle. Because Craft keys plugin settings by
handle, upgrading does not carry your settings over — you will need to reconnect
Google and re-enter your GA4 property ID. See the
[upgrade steps in the changelog](CHANGELOG.md#200---2026-08-18).

## Google Cloud Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a project
3. Enable the **Google Analytics Data API** and the **Google Search Console API** (APIs & Services > Library)
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Add the **Authorized redirect URI** shown in the plugin settings page
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Plugin Configuration

1. Go to **Settings > Plugins > Analytics** in the Craft CP
2. Enter your **GA4 Property ID** (numeric ID from GA4 Admin > Property Settings, e.g. `123456789`)
3. Enter your **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret**
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Connect to Google** and authorize access
6. You're connected — visit the **Analytics** section in the CP sidebar

### Environment Variables

All settings support environment variables:

```env
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Then in plugin settings, use `$GA4_PROPERTY_ID`, `$GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `$GA4_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Permissions

The plugin registers two permissions under **Settings > Users**:

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| **View Analytics** | Access the Analytics CP page and dashboard widget |
| **Manage Analytics** | Clear cache and refresh data (nested under View) |

Admin users always have full access. OAuth connection and plugin settings are restricted to admins only.

## Cache

API responses are cached for 5 minutes by default. You can change this in the plugin settings (Cache Duration field). Click **Clear Cache & Refresh** on the Analytics page to force a refresh.

## Translations

The plugin ships with English and French translations. Translation files are located in `src/translations/`.
